# what is this? 

A timer web application that keeps track of small/big blinds during a poker game. Intended to be projected next to or near the game.

This is a Blazor rewrite of my earlier React prototype: [poker-time](https://github.com/GillesDV/poker-timer)  

# Features
- Current small & big blind shown
- Next small & big blind shown
- A countdown timer to show when the blinds will raise 
- A view to see how much each colored chip is worth
- A management panel to 
-- modify the timer & fast forward it
-- set the amount of players

# Tech stack:
- .NET 8.0 (LTS) 
- CSS library: [MudBlazor](https://mudblazor.com/)
